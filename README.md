**ABOUT**

This is a command prompt program that rolls dice. It is written in C++ using Orwell Dev-C++ 5.11.

Currently supported dice are d2, d4, d6 (the standard playing die), d8, d10, d12, d20 and d100. d100 rolls 100 instead of 0 and 00, something to be taken into account depending on the specific game that's being played. The user can also select the amount od dice to be rolled and can input any number modifier if needed. At the end, the program outputs what results have been "rolled", what's their sum and, if there was a modifier, what's the final sum of dice sum + modifiers.
